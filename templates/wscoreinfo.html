    <div class="explanation-text">
    <p>The Water Score is designed to help farmers understand the impact of different management practices on water quality, based on how much adopting them contributes to reducing water pollution. </p></div>

    <div class="explanation-text">
    <p>To develop this tool, we consulted environmental experts who ranked various farming practices based on their effectiveness at reducing nitrogen pollution in water. These comparisons were done using a structured rating scale (modified from Elliott, 2010 and Saaty, 2006), where each practice was evaluated for its relative importance within its category, such as feeding, production efficiency, manure management, grazing, and livestock intensity. </p>
    <p>Based on these expert rankings, we assigned weights for each practice, as well as for each category. Each practice contributes differently to the total score depending on its individual weight, the weight of its category and whether it is implemented. The table below shows the weights assigned to practices and their respective categories. </p></div>

    <div class="explanation-text">
    <p>When you select the practices you use on your farm, the calculator adds up the weights for those practices and compares your score to the maximum possible score. Based on this, your farm receives a grade from A to E: A means your practices are highly effective at protecting water quality, E suggests there is significant room for improvement.</p>
    <p>This score aims to provide a clear image of how your farmâ€™s decisions influence water health, helping you evaluate your progress and identify opportunities to improve.</p> </div>
